# How It Works

## How long is each WITspiration Cycle?

Each circle should be operating for a year. We want to make sure groups have a chance to get to know each other and build a relationship to help each other.

## Types of groups

At sign up, members can indicate that they wish to be part the the larger group only (everyone), be part of a smaller group (smaller circle) that uses chat for communication or be part of a smaller group that the meets live (Zoom/Teams/etc). Members will indicate their preference at sign up.

## More details on circles

### How are circles assigned?

Members will indicate their availability meet with other members based on the following time slots (all times are Eastern Standard Time):

- 1st Tuesday at 2pm
- 2nd Friday at 5pm
- 3rd Thursday at 3pm
- 4th Monday at 5pm

Members will then will be added to the monthly Zoom meeting for that time slot.

### What happens if the circle members find their circle isnâ€™t the best fit?

Because we want to make sure that each group succeeds, if members are finding that the circle they are in is not the best fit, we will have check-in points to allow for adjustments to be made along the way.

If there are larger issues at play, please contact the organizers to help mediate any situations that arise.

### Will there be interaction between the different circles?

There are monthly meetings on the first Wednesday alternating between at 2 PM and 5 PM EST with for everyone to be able to participate as a larger group.
