# Roles and Organization of the WITspiration Mentoring Circles

## Overall Structure:
WITSpiration is made up of different mentoring circles. The number of circles and members in each will be determined by the overall number of people participating. The goal is for each mentoring circle to be self-led. But there will be an organizational structure in place to help facilitate and support the needs of each group.

## Organizational Structure:
- Organizers: 
    - Deborah Melkin and Tracy Boggiano
