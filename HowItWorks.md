# How It Works

## How long is each WITspiration Cycle?
Each circle should be operating for a year. We want to make sure each group has a chance to get to know each other and build a relationship to help each other group.

## Types of groups
At sign up, members can indicate that they wish to be part the the larger group only (everyone), be part of a smaller group (smaller circle) that uses chat for communication or be part of a smaller group that the meets live (Zoom/Teams/etc). Members will indicate their perference at sign up.

## More details on circles 
### How are circles assigned?
Members will indicate their interests as part of the sign up. Circles will be assigned based on interests. Circles aren’t bound to discuss topics only in these areas because as everyone works together, the topics may necessarily change. These interests can also change year to year as this community grows.

### What happens if the circle members find their circle isn’t the best fit?
Because we want to make sure that each group succeeds, if members are finding that the circle they are in is not the best fit, we will have check-in points to allow for adjustments to be made along the way. 

If there are larger issues at play, please contact the organizers to help mediate any situations that arise. 

### What is the role of the circle leader?
The role of the Circle Leader is an organizational one. That person will be responsible for making sure the group is meeting and with communication back to the organizers. For circles wishing to meeting via Teams/Zoom/etc. Deb and Tracy will help facitliate the first meeting between the circle memebrs to make sure the cirlce gets off to a smooth beginning.

### Will there be interaction between the different circles?
There are monthly meetings on the first Tuesday at noon EST with everyone and Thursday noon GMT for everyone to be able to participate as a larger group to get together.

### How often is each circle expected to meet?
This will be determined by each circle. We would like to see each circle hold a meeting at least once a month. The circle can and should feel free to communicate via email or chats or other channels if they would like. The purpose is that each circle should be able to be flexible enough so that all members are able to participate and not feel overly burdened.

### How many people in each circle?
Each circle should be 4-5 people. As everyone in the circle will be acting as mentors to each other, we don’t want to overwhelm each circle with too many people. As this is designed to be mentoring circles, we also don’t want to assign 1:1 mentorships.
