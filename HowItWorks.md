# How It Works

## How long is each WITspiration Cycle?
Each circle should be operating for a year. We want to make sure each group has a chance to get to know each other and build a relationship to help each other group.

## How are circles assigned?
Members will indicate their interests as part of the sign up. Circles will be assigned based on these interests. Circles aren’t bound to discuss topics only in these areas because as everyone works together, the topics may necessarily change. These interests can also change year to year as this community grows.

## What happens if the circle members find their circle isn’t the best fit?
Because we want to make sure that each group succeeds, if members are finding that the circle they are in is not the best fit, we will have check-in points to allow for adjustments to be made along the way. 

If there are larger issues at play, please contact the organizers to help mediate any situations that arise. 

## What is the role of the Circle Leader?
The role of the Circle Leader is an organizational one. That person will be responsible for making sure the group is meeting and with communication back to the organizers.

## Will there be interaction between the different groups?
To be determined…. If this is something the different cycles would like, we can certainly figure something out.

## How often is each group expected to meet?
This will be determined by each group. We would like to see each group hold a meeting at least once a month. The group can and should feel free to communicate via email or chats or other channels if they would like. The purpose is that each group should be able to be flexible enough so that all members are able to participate and not feel overly burdened.

## How many people in each circle?
Each circle should be 3-4 people. As everyone in the group will be acting as mentors to each other, we don’t want to overwhelm each group with too many people. As this is designed to be mentoring circles, we also don’t want to assign 1:1 mentorships.

## Sign Ups
We are always accepting applications but only assign circles in three month cicles.  If you are interesting in signing up complete this [Goople Form](https://tinyurl.com/WITspirationInterest) and we will be in touch soon.
